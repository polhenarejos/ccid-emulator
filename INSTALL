Installation is simple; type `make install`.  If you want to customize the
compilation or install process, you will need to pass variables to make.

    DESTDIR             prefix for installation
    OPENSC_CFLAGS       compiler flags for libopensc usage (needed if no
                        pkg-config is available)
    OPENSSL_CFLAGS      compiler flags for libssl usage (needed if no
                        pkg-config is available)
    PACE                set it to something (e.g. "yes") to enable PACE, make
                        sure that your openssl is compiled with the OpenPACE
                        patch

See the Makefile for more details.

Example:
    make DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install

Note: If you want to uninstall the binary, you need to pass the same DESTDIR
to make, for example `make DESTDIR=/tmp/stage uninstall`.
