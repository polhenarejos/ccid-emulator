Installation is simple; type `make install`.  If you want to customize the
compilation or install process, you will need to pass variables to make.

    DESTDIR             prefix for installation
    LIBPCSCLITE_CFLAGS  compiler flags for pcsclite usage (needed if no
                        pkg-config is available)

See the Makefile for more details.

Example:
    make DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install

Note: If you want to uninstall the binary, you need to pass the same DESTDIR
to make, for example `make DESTDIR=/tmp/stage uninstall`.
